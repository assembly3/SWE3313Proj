# SWE3313Proj
Class Project for Members of Group 4

9/9/2023
Hi team, and members of Group 4. Have managed to implement Maven in JavaFX to run two GUIs, for now.
Coverted the snapshot Jar of the Maven Package into an exe that opens in JavaFX.
Will have to figure how to run JavaFX.jar file (Java.Application.Application error found).
The other two jar files in the directory of the JavaFX_Project Project can be ignored for now.
Be sure to remove the " - copy", when testing the code.

Quick update on the following day, multiple maven class files can be loaded within JavaFX with
jar file added to project structure global library, and addition to module-info.java.
